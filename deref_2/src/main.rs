/// Deref coercion converts a reference to a type that implements the Deref trait into a reference to another type. For example, deref coercion can convert &String to &str because String implements the Deref trait such that it returns &str. Deref coercion is a convenience Rust performs on arguments to functions and methods, and it works only on types that implement the Deref trait. It happens automatically when we pass a reference to a particular type’s value as an argument to a function or method that doesn’t match the parameter type in the function or method definition. A sequence of calls to the deref method converts the type we provided into the type the parameter needs.

/// When the Deref trait is defined for the types involved, Rust will analyze the types and use Deref::deref as many times as necessary to get a reference to match the parameter’s type. The number of times that Deref::deref needs to be inserted is resolved at compile time, so there is no runtime penalty for taking advantage of deref coercion!
